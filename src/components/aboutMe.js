      <p>ABOUT ME</p>
      <p>
        I started my professional career in the automotive industry as a CNC machinery and PLC automation programmer at a very early age thanks to the family business.
        Although I still love what I did for so many years, I have always been interested in software programming, so in 2022 I decided to come to Montreal, QC to study and give myself the opportunity to enter this world that quickly became my passion.
      </p>
      <p>I AM CURRENTLY STUDYING MY LAST SEMESTER AND I AM LOOKING FOR AN INTERNSHIP FOR FALL 2024.</p>
      <p>Check out my work experience in detail on LinkedIn.</p>
